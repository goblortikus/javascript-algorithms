- Monir Mamoun

These are my implementations of various algorithms in Javascript. Every few years, when I forget what a so-and-so sort is, or am possessed by an utterly inexplicable desire to relearn recursive algorithms I never use, or when I'm just feeling insecure about my CS skills, I read my old CS books (read: "fondly cast a glace at the copy of _Introduction to Algorithms_ rotting on my shelf while I google up an explanation of bubble sort") and write some code. Some of _that_ code is included in these somewhat self-descriptive files. Go and explore. Everything in this repo is free for the taking. Public domain and all that jazz. 

This code is just a bunch of exercises. It is exactly the kind of javascript code I never write in real applications... because there are a million npm modules out there to do it and it comes up so rarely in front-end (or even back end) JS code in production apps. But it's sometimes useful to have an idea what sorts/algos are doing behind the scenes, if only to understand big-O performance implications.
